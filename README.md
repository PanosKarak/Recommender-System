# Recommender-System
This repository contains the implementation developed for my MSc thesis on movie recommendation systems, using MovieLens 32M and two approaches: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. It is an ongoing process with the hybrid method coming along the way.
I have included a download file for the MovieLens dataset. Simply run the program for the download to begin. I have also included a preproccess file, which splits the original dataset in a train set and test set with an 80/20 percentage.
